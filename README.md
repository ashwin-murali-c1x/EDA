# EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis on Capacity logs, Impression logs, Click logs, Pixel logs

EDA is a philosophy as to how we dissect a dataset, what we look for, how we look and how we interpret. EDA heavily uses the collection of techniques that we call statistical graphics. The objectives of EDA are to: 
  maximize insight into a data set
  uncover underlying structure
  extract important variables
  detect outliers and anomalies
  test underlying assumptions
  Check for missing data and other mistakes
  Check assumptions associated with any model fitting or hypothesis test
  Identify the most influential variable
