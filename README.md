# EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis on Capacity logs, Impression logs, Click logs, Pixel logs

EDA is a philosophy as to how we dissect a dataset, what we look for, how we look and how we interpret. EDA heavily uses the collection of techniques that we call statistical graphics. The objectives of EDA are to: 
  1. maximize insight into a data set
  2. uncover underlying structure
  3. extract important variables
  4. detect outliers and anomalies
  5. test underlying assumptions
  6. Check for missing data and other mistakes
  7. Check assumptions associated with any model fitting or hypothesis test
  8. Identify the most influential variable
